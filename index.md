# The Chelmsford Method
## Rebuilding Techne in the Coffeehouse Age
### A Civic Field Guide and Proposal for Reviving Technological Community Without an Industrial Base
**By Andrew Lewis, Chair – Chelmsford Techne Circle**

Welcome to the official home of the **Chelmsford Method**, a locally proven model for rebuilding civic and technological fellowship in the post-industrial world.

This GitHub-hosted guide is part **manifesto**, part **field manual** for forming *Techne Circles* — open gatherings of thinkers, builders, and learners who meet regularly over coffee to share what they've made, wrestle with new ideas, and rebuild our common technological life, one conversation at a time.

## 🧠 Start a Techne Circle
1. Choose a public meeting spot like a café.
2. Set a regular day and time.
3. Sit, introduce yourselves, and go around the table: each person shares their **Week in Tech**.
4. Offer gentle input, reflections, or help.
5. Close with open discussion and informal chats.

**No dues. No hierarchy. Just attention, curiosity, and craft.**
